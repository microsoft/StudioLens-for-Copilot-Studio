# Path 1 — Dataverse (Direct)

The **simplest** StudioLens build: the Power BI template reads Copilot Studio conversation transcripts
**straight from Dataverse** and parses them **inside the model** (Power Query M). No Fabric capacity,
no Lakehouse, no notebooks — just the `.pbit`, a Dataverse environment, and an org-data CSV.

> Want scheduled Spark ingestion, larger volumes, or the **PPAC message-credit** pages? Use
> [**Path 2 — Fabric**](../2.%20Fabric/) instead.

## Connect the template

The `.pbit` is **pre-set to Dataverse** — you only set three parameters:

| Parameter | Required? | Value |
|---|---|---|
| **Dataverse Url** | **Yes** | your environment URL, e.g. `https://yourorg.crm.dynamics.com` — or **several** separated by `;` to combine environments (see below) |
| **Org Data CSV** | **Yes** | full file path (SharePoint URL or local/synced/UNC) to `copilot_org_data.csv` |
| **Agent 365 CSV** | optional | full file path to `agents_365.csv` — **leave blank to skip** |

On first refresh you'll get a one-time **Dataverse** sign-in: choose **Organizational account**, sign
in with an org login that can **read the Conversation Transcript table**, and set the source privacy
level to **Organizational** if prompted. Then enable **Scheduled refresh** in the Service as usual.

> **No app registration / client secret** — the report uses the native Dataverse connector with the
> refresher's own org login.

<details>
<summary><strong>Multiple environments in one report</strong> — combine several Dataverse orgs</summary>

The **Dataverse Url** parameter accepts **more than one environment URL**, separated by a **semicolon**
(or one per line):

```
https://org-a.crm.dynamics.com; https://org-b.crm.dynamics.com; https://org-c.crm.dynamics.com
```

The model pulls `conversationtranscripts` from **every** environment in a single refresh, tags each row
with the source **`environment`**, and unions them — so all agents across all environments appear in
one report. A single URL still works exactly as before.

**Robust by design:** each environment is fetched independently inside a `try…otherwise`, so an
unreachable or empty environment is **skipped**, not fatal — the refresh still completes with the
environments that did respond.

**What you need to do:**

1. **List the environment URLs** in the **Dataverse Url** parameter, semicolon-separated (Power Platform
   Admin Center → Environments → *each env* → **Environment URL**).
2. **Read access in every environment.** The refresher's org login needs **Read** on the **Conversation
   Transcript** table in **each** environment (same role as the single-env case — e.g. System
   Customizer / Environment Maker — granted per environment).
3. **Sign in per environment on first refresh.** Each environment URL is a **separate data source**, so
   Power BI prompts once per environment — choose **Organizational account** and set privacy to
   **Organizational** for each. In the Service, **Scheduled refresh** needs credentials configured for
   **every** environment URL under dataset **Settings → Data source credentials**.
4. **Keep privacy levels consistent** (all **Organizational**) across the environment sources and the
   Org Data CSV, or Power Query's *Formula.Firewall* may block combining them.
5. **Refresh.** All environments load into one model; the `environment` tag is available on the base
   transcript data for filtering.

> **Optional — surface an Environment slicer.** Row-level `environment` is carried on the parsed base
> data. To slice a specific fact table (e.g. *Agent Sessions*) by environment, add `environment` to that
> table's `Table.SelectColumns(...)` output in the parser function, then drop a slicer on the column.

<summary><strong>What you need</strong> — environment, permissions & CSVs</summary>

**In your tenant**
- The **Dataverse environment URL** holding the Copilot Studio transcripts (Power Platform Admin
  Center → Environments → *your env* → **Environment URL**).
- A refresher sign-in with **Read** on the **Conversation Transcript** table — e.g. *System
  Administrator*, *System Customizer*, *Environment Maker*, or a least-privilege custom role.

**Supporting CSVs** (each pointed to by its own full-path parameter):

| File | Source export | Parameter | Required? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `copilot_org_data.csv` | Entra → Users (manual export) **or** a Graph `/users` → SharePoint landing flow | **Org Data CSV** | **Yes** (org filter on every page) |
| `agents_365.csv` | M365 Admin → Agents → **Export** | **Agent 365 CSV** | optional |

Org data is read from the **raw portal export** — the model normalises headers and US-format dates
for you. Leave the Agents 365 path blank and that table loads empty (visuals degrade gracefully).

> **Org data stays a CSV (not Dataverse)** so you keep both acquisition methods — a manual Entra
> export, or an Entra-Graph → SharePoint landing flow.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How the file paths work</strong> — connectors & gateway</summary>

Each CSV parameter takes a **full file path**, auto-detected:

| You enter | Connector | Refresh in the Service |
|---|---|---|
| A **SharePoint file URL** (`https://contoso.sharepoint.com/.../copilot_org_data.csv`) | `Web.Contents` | ✅ cloud-to-cloud, **no gateway** (source = *Organizational account* / OAuth2) |
| A **local / synced file** (`C:\AIBV\copilot_org_data.csv`) | `File.Contents` | needs an **on-premises data gateway** |
| A **UNC path** (`\\server\share\copilot_org_data.csv`) | `File.Contents` | needs a gateway |

> A **SharePoint file URL is easiest to schedule-refresh** — no gateway. Pointing at the exact file
> (not a folder) means the report won't silently miss a renamed export.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How the transcript parser works</strong></summary>

The model carries Power Query functions (see
[`model_expressions_reference.tmdl`](./model_expressions_reference.tmdl)) that parse the raw
`conversationtranscripts` JSON into fact tables — entirely in the model, no external compute:

| M function | Produces |
|---|---|
| `RawTranscripts()` | one row per transcript (live from Dataverse) |
| `ParsedBase()` | parses each `content` JSON once into an `activities` list |
| `Parse_Sessions()` | `Agent Sessions` (one row per conversation) |
| `Parse_Turns()` | `Agent Turns` (per message, with intent / knowledge / feedback) |
| `Parse_Errors()` | `Agent Errors` |
| `Parse_SubAgents()` | `Agent Sub-Agent Calls` |
| `Parse_Performance()` | `Agent Performance` (per-conversation KPI fact) |

`Agent Catalogue` self-derives from the parsed sessions + sub-agents.

**Notes / limitations**
- **Topics** are classified by generic, customer-agnostic DAX — no extra services or LLM enrichment.
- **Agent name** resolves via the Dataverse bot lookup where exposed, else from transcript content.
- Token / plugin telemetry columns are null in this path (not in the transcript JSON); the value
  model doesn't depend on them.
- Conversation transcripts default to ~30-day retention in Dataverse — the dashboard sees only what
  the environment currently holds.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Verifying the connection</strong></summary>

A built-in **`Dataverse Diagnostic`** table returns the live row count of `conversationtranscripts`
and `systemusers`. If `conversationtranscripts = 0` but `systemusers > 0`, the connection is fine —
the environment simply has no Copilot Studio transcripts in scope yet.
